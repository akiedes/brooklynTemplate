                <br />
                <b>By entering any tournament</b>, players agree that ICC and the organizers cannot guarantee that they will not as a result become infected with COVID-19. Entrants further certify that during the 10-day period before the tournament, they have not experienced any symptoms associated with COVID-19, which include fever, cough, or shortness of breath, or had close or direct contact with anyone who is either confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Masks may be required in all public spaces, if we announce "masks required."</b> This includes, but is not limited to, players in games, tournament staff, and other attendees. We may also require proof of full vaccinations and/or a negative COVID test 72 hours before the tournament.  Please check out COVID policies on our website at www.chessclub.com/iccnyc  frequently before the tournament, as our these may change as we get closer to the event.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Players are encouraged to receive pairings</b> by text or email. You should be able to check standings online prior to entering the playing hall. Pairings will probably be posted at the site, but you should endeavor to find your information BEFORE you arrive.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Crowds should not congregate</b> around pairings or standings or outside doors of the playing halls. Social distancing principles and any markers must be respected.  Failure to observe social distancing if required may result in removal from the tournament and/or site, without refund.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Non-playing spectators</b> may be restricted, depending on circumstances.<br />
                <br />
                <b>BEST PRACTICE SUGGESTIONS:</b> Please try to limit the number of non-players in tournament areas.  If you have a group of young players competing, please consider assigning no more than one or two parents to wait for those players at any given time. This will reduce the crowds around exits and in hallways, which promotes a safer atmosphere for everyone.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Within 10 days of the tournament</b>, if you experience any symptoms consistent with COVID-19, please do NOT attend. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, fever, respiratory distress, and shortness of breath. If within 10 days of the tournament, you have any close or direct contact with anyone who is either confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19, please do NOT attend. This includes close or direct contact with anyone who is experiencing or displaying any symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
